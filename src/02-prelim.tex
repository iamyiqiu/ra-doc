\section{Preliminaries on robo-advisors}
% Robo-advisors are digital investment platforms that utilize advanced algorithms to provide automated investment advice and portfolio management services. These platforms have gained popularity in recent years due to their low fees, convenience, and ability to offer personalized investment advice to individual investors. Robo-advisors were created to address the high fees and minimum investment requirements associated with traditional financial advisors, making investment management more accessible and affordable for a wider range of investors.

% The origins of robo-advisors can be traced back to the early 2000s, when the first online investment platforms like Betterment and Wealthfront emerged. These platforms used algorithms to determine asset allocation and rebalancing strategies, offering low-cost, automated investment advice and portfolio management services to individual investors. As technology advanced, more traditional financial institutions began to offer robo-advisory services, either by developing their own in-house platforms or partnering with existing fintech firms.

% One of the primary advantages of robo-advisors is their low fees. Robo-advisors typically charge much lower fees than traditional financial advisors, making them an attractive option for investors with smaller account balances. Additionally, robo-advisors use advanced algorithms to develop customized investment portfolios that are tailored to an investor's individual risk tolerance and investment goals, which can help investors achieve better investment returns and reduce the risk of portfolio losses. Robo-advisors also offer convenience and accessibility, as investors can access their accounts and manage their investments from anywhere with an internet connection.

% The current state of the robo-advisory industry is one of rapid growth and innovation. As more investors turn to digital investment platforms, the number of robo-advisors on the market continues to increase, and established players are expanding their offerings to remain competitive. Many robo-advisors are also becoming more sophisticated, offering a wider range of investment options such as socially responsible investing and alternative investments. However, there are also concerns around the risk of losing control over investments and the need for greater regulatory oversight.

% In conclusion, robo-advisors are digital investment platforms that use algorithms to provide low-cost, convenient investment management services to individual investors. These platforms have gained popularity due to their ability to offer personalized investment advice and portfolios that are tailored to an investor's unique needs. The robo-advisory industry is rapidly evolving, with more players entering the market and existing players expanding their offerings. However, there are also challenges to be addressed, including the risk of losing control over investments and the need for greater regulatory oversight.
